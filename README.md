Ornamental Flower Classification â€“ Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning
This project focuses on classifying ornamental flowers using transfer learning and fine-tuning with ResNet50, VGG16, and EfficientNet. By leveraging pre-trained models, we improve classification accuracy while keeping training efficient.

Features
Transfer Learning: Adapts ResNet50, VGG16, and EfficientNet for flower classification
Fine-Tuning: Optimizes selected layers for improved performance
Dataset Preprocessing: Handles image resizing, normalization, and augmentation
Performance Evaluation: Uses accuracy, loss metrics, and validation checks
